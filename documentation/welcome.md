# Zoover

Hi. Welcome to Zoover. 

# What's Zoover?

Zoover is a new social network. An honest one, and one that is straightforward to use. 
There's no likes, hearts, nothing. Just text. Share what's on your mind. 

# Why'd you create another one of these?

Social networking has always been about connections. This project aims to bring a social network into the mix
that is simple and straightforward, while being open source and easy to use. 

# Can I deploy my own Zoover?

Yep! Clone this repository via Git and just type "npm start". Node.js is already configured and ready to go. 
It will start up automatically on port 5000. 

When you run your own Zoover, please make sure to note that yours is not the original Zoover. You are not permitted
under the license to use the name "Zoover" without permission. 

Have fun!
